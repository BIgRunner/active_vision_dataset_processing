#DATA LOADING

Here we provide an incomplete class for loading our data. While it almost certainly
does not do exactly what you want, it may be a good starting point for seeing
how to access our data.

The code is written for pytorch, but this dependency should be easily removable. In fact
it is this dependency that causes the class to be so imcomplete.

See the `demo.py` file for a few different ways to use the class with/without pytorch.
The code is meant to be read, and so there are extensive(too many) comments.

The hope is someone can copy and paste the class, and then edit it easily to 
match their needs. Goodluck!

Hopefully this will be updated in the near future.
