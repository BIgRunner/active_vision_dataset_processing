#Active Vision Dataset Processing

This project contains Python and MATLAB scripts for processing the
 [Active Vision Dataset](http://cs.unc.edu/~ammirato/active_vision_dataset_website/index.html)
It is an active project, with more and updated code to come.


To get started, edit the `ROHIT_BASE_PATH` variable in `run.py` and/or `init_paths.m`
to point to the directory that contains our data. i.e. the parent directory 
that the directory for each scan.

```
  ROHIT_BASE_PATH = /path/to/dataset/
```

##Running code
Everything is a function. See examples below
for how to run certain functions, or look at the README
in your directory of interest. (Currently `visualizations` 
is the only interesting one)
###Python
To run a python function from the command line:
  ```
  python run.py function_name scene_name
  ```

###MATLAB
1. Start MATLAB
2. Run `init_paths`
3. Call the desired function



#Visualizations
Use the code here to visualize our data.


#DATA LOADING
A starting point for loading our data in python.
